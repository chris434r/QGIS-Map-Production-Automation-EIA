Work in progress QGIS plug in which automates the production of environmental impact assessment maps.

Output of nine maps as image files and as QGIS map document files, are as follows:

"Map 1 - Site Location Plan"
"Map 2 - Air Quality Constraints"
"Map 3 - Environmental Constraints"
"Map 4 - Priority Habitat"
"Map 5 - Non Designated Assets"
"Map 6 - Designated Assets"
"Map 7 - Landscape Constraints"
"Map 8 - Noise Constraints"
"Map 9 - Surface Water"

All QGIS map documents contain pre loaded extents and symbology files applied, and layers can be added or removed at will.

In addition the map document will contain a pre loaded layout file, so the user can adjust titles or add additional items such as client logo.

The plugin also generates file folders for storing of data and outputs, so all data can easily be found and inspected.
